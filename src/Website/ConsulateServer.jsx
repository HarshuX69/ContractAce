                            <p class="text-white text-start">Consultants providing engineering and commercial services to clients can register and create their own space for e-tendering and procurement services. They can create their own suite of standard contract templates which can be used for all their tendering needs. The documents can be made efficiently and sent online to contractors for pricing. This will considerably reduce the paper and printing requirements and there is a clear audit trail for the processes followed. The process of selecting the contractors also becomes easier and more transparent.</p>
